Low Poly Medieval Castle Pack
Pack Creator: Ventuar
v1.1.0
------------------------------------------------
To use: Drag and drop prefabs from Prefabs folder into scene and assemble to fit your needs.

**Due to pivot point and rotation changes in v1.05 and beyond, objects may be shifted out of their previous positions when updating to newer
versions. These changes may likely require manual adjustment by the developer to use as they were previously**

Tip: To achieve intended graphical results, switch Color Space (Project Settings > Player > Other Settings) from Gamma 
to Linear, and set Shadow Distance (Project Settings > Quality) to 300-400.

Skyboxes in the trailer come from ProAssets:
