  sentences:
  - "Ah, I see that I have joined a young soul in this endeavour. You see youngling,
    I was thrown away by Thor, the god of thunder, as he got into his battle with
    the World Serpent. Unfortunately, I won\u2019t be able to give the innate thunder
    abilities of Thor but I can be thrown at immense speed and recall back to you."
  - "Now little one. Let\u2019s try to train you a little in using the hammer. Let\u2019s
    go over to the harbour and sink two of those ships. Nobody is going to use them
    now, are they?\r"
  - 'Good, young one. Very good. This village, as far as I can feel, is haunted by
    ice spirits. There used to be fire spirits around here to warm up the village.
    Perhaps they are trapped within some ice crystals. Go around and see if you can
    use the hammer to free them. '
  - "You know, I was once forged to defend this realm from various creatures from
    other realms. Thor used me so much that he doesn\u2019t even consider that I
    have feelings."
  - Some fires and lights are not completely lit near the church. Perhaps something
    happened there and needs our attention.
  - There is one of the infamous ice spirit I talked about earlier. Do be careful
    as they fire out Ice spells which I would prefer if you avoided. If you get close
    enough to the bonfires, we can enable the fire to turn back to normal and scare
    it away.
  - "I see another fire spirit trapped. You know the drill. Don\u2019t let this be
    trapped forever."
  - "It\u2019s strange, isn\u2019t it? How the whole world is about to end and yet
    I don\u2019t feel anything.\r \nMaybe the world isn\u2019t about to end because
    I haven\u2019t seen any signs of Naglfar yet.\r.. \nDamn it, why did I say that,
    now Naglfar will definitely show up.\r\n"
  - Oh, dear. It seems you have angered Naglfar, the ship of the damned. He is powerful,
    but those ice crystals are where he is the weakest. Try to destroy them and he
    will go to where he came from.
  natureSentences:
  - Great, now that you have freed the fire spirit, there is another spirit trapped
    in the tree over there with the flowers.
  - 'There is another spirit trapped near the inn of where you found me.

'
  - 'Great, now that you have freed the fire spirit, I can feel a spirit is trapped
    where they hang laundry on the other side of the town.

'
  - There is another spirit trapped in a tree further down the path.
  - Thank you for freeing all of those spirits. The last spirit is trapped in a lamppost,
    in the market place
